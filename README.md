## Instructions

**All of your tasks are to be done in the file `src/main/java/Silly.java`.** For your convenience,
we have labelled each task with a **TODO** and included instructions at the top of the file.

For this exercise, you can either complete it through the GitHub UI or try to run it through IntelliJ.

### Readings
For this exercise, you will want to read through **Chapter 2: Class Features**.

For each of the tasks in `Silly.java`, we have included a brief summary of the relevant reading to
help you.

### Doing this exercise in IntelliJ
Refer to the instructions from the `01-intro-to-java` exercise's README.md.

Make sure you set the folder `java` under `src/main` as Sources Root.

### Testing your code

After you add, commit, **and** push your changes to GitHub, check your `Silly.java` file and make sure you have the correct version submitted.

You can run the tests in `src/test/java/SillyTest.java` to test your code. When you push to GitHub, the Actions tab will also try to run the same test cases: use this to verify whether your submission was done correctly!
